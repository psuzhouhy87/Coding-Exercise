Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.

Example:
Given a = 1 and b = 2, return 3.


class Solution {
public:
    int getSum(int a, int b) {
        int sum = a;
        
        while (b != 0)
        {
            sum = a ^ b;//calculate sum of a and b without thinking the carry 
            b = (a & b) << 1;//calculate the carry
            a = sum;//add sum(without carry) and carry
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
};

Example:
    a = 4, b = 5;
    a = 100; b = 101;
    loop 1: sum = a = 100, b = 101 != 0; -> sum  = a ^ b = 001; b = (a & b) << 1 = 100 << 1 = 1000; a = 001;
    loop 2: sum = a ^ b = 1001; b = (a & b) << 1 = (001 & 1000) << 1 = 00000; a = sum = 1001;
    loop 3: b = 0; break;
    result 1001 = 9;
    
Note:
    a ^ b --> calculate sum of a and b without thinking the carry;
    a & b --> calculate the carry at current location;
    (a & b) << 1 --> move the carry to upper postion which should be for the calculation;
    b --> present the carry, so as the carry is zero means we get the final result.
    
A summary: how to use bit manipulation to solve problems easily and efficiently
    Set union A | B
    Set intersection A & B
    Set subtraction A & ~B
    Set negation ALL_BITS ^ A or ~A
    Set bit A |= 1 << bit
    Clear bit A &= ~(1 << bit)
    Test bit (A & 1 << bit) != 0
    Extract last bit A&-A or A&~(A-1) or x^(x&(x-1))
    Remove last bit A&(A-1)
    Get all 1-bits ~0
    
    Example:
        # count the number of ones in the binary representation of the given number
            int count_one(int n){
                while(n){
                    n = n & (n-1);
                    count++;
                }
                return count;
             }
        # Determine whether is power of four
            bool isPowerofFour(int n){
                return !(n & (n-1)) && (n & 0x55555555);
            }
